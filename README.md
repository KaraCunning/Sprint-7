Model Interpretation

Use the ROC AUC classification metric
Choosing a target and avoiding leakage of information
Explore and join relational data for supervised learning
Get permutation importances for model interpretation and feature selection
Use xgboost for gradient boosting
Visualize and interpret Partial Dependence & Shapley value plots
 - Target if there is a Great Work Life Balance when certain features are inplace
 - This dataset is a classification problem
 - Evaluation metrics - accuracy score and the AUC (area below the ROC curve)
 - using time-based split for the train, val and test split
 - looks like there is a value in my val set that might be an outlier ['1/1/00'] might 'ignore' as it may have been a typo for the date and do not know what the user meant for that date to be
